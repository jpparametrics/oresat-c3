OreSat Radio Overview

*Frise equation system noise equation
*Dual 3v3, 2v5 LDO (possibly settable with precision resistors)
*Keep separate 1V8 LDOs for each L, UHF TCXO
*Separate SPS @ 5V0 for Radios Td off VBUSP
*RF choke on power line to 5V0 LDO
*Use NPO capacitors (Temp compensated)
*Lucid charts student for access to Vigeley's Block diagrams
*Ground plane connection under AX5043s (We need a solid connection for Tx PAs current draw)
*To be implemented for C3-v2
--Segregate RF and MCU ground planes
--Move eMMC and compactify non RF components
--implement all RF power components
--+5V0 SPS 
--+3V3,2.5 LDO (dual settable)
*To be implemented for C3-v3
--Complete RF front ends (rough is ok)
