VCTRL on TCXO is open on actual part (so don't need R4,5 , C9, JP5)

Have plenty of following part - (1.8V LDO)
							  - (TCXO)

Test Goal: Send and receive a test pattern. could use one to transmit and one to receive. Bit error rate test.
Figure out how to test radio circuit blocks in succession. (Mini 50 ohm flex lines and terminations?)
Ask if andrew wants full TX/RX on both radios.

In the future need LDO's separate for UHF and L band LNAs @ 2.7V.

On transmit UHF PA will raise radio power to 2.5 W. May need 0.350 A for radios alone.
