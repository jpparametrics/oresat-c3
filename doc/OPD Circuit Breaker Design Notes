OPD Circuit breaker design notes
Part Maxim - MAX892L

This information is all from the data sheet.

1. IC needs an active low on EN pin 3 to turn on.

2. Limiting current is set by R_SET on pin 5 to ground. The resistor value is chosen
	according to the following equations.
	I_SET = I_LIMIT / I_RATIO
	R_SET = 1.240 / I_SET
	I_RATIO = 965 [p6]
	As designed I_SET = 50mA so R_SET = 23932.

3. The net OPD_I_SET provides the voltage developed by a replica of I_OUT through R_set
	to ground. This current is I_OUT / 965. The output current can then be monitored by
	the MCU on this net.
	
4. The fault pin 6 is an open drain active low and is pulled to ground when the IC starts
	current limiting or when the IC temperature exceeds 135C.

5. This part is an auto retry. If the IC exceeds 135C it turns off and then turns back on
	after the junction temp drops 10C. This can result in a pulsed output if the fault is
	not corrected.
