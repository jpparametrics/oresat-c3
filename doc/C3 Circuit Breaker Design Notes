C3 Main Circuit breaker design notes
Part TI - TPS259621

This information is all from the data sheet.

1. Pins 2 and 8 are left intentionaly open. Pin 2 is to set a longer inrush
	slew rate and pin 8 is left open to set 13.7V as the over voltage clamp set
	point [p21].

2. The Voltage divider on pin 3 sets the under voltage set point as follows
	VIN_(UV) = V_UVLO*(R1+R2)/R2. [p19] Where V_UVLO = 1.2 V [p7], VIN_(UV) is the threshold 
	at which the IC turns on the power rail and R1 = R2 = 10k With this config the threshold is 
	2.4 V. 

3. The resistor at pin 7 sets the limit current according to the equation
	R_ILM (Ohms) = 903 / (I_LIM (A) - 0.0112) [p22]. With the R_ILM = 3.1k, I_LIM = 0.302 (A).
	You can also monitor the input current by routing this pin to an analog input 
	on the MCU.

4. Pin 6 is left open because this is pulled low when the IC cuts power to 
	the rail. If that happens the MCU wont be there to see this pin go low anyay.

5. This part is an auto retry. If an overvoltage or over current condition 
	persists, it enters thermal shutdown at 157 C and cuts power to the rail [p7]. It then 
	restablishes power after it has cooled down 11.5 C and 95 ms have elapsed [p8].
