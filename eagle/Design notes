X1.watchdog chip; open drain version, way better. (pull up resistor will be needed to shutdown)

X2.be able to powercycle card
	-pchannel mosfet to pin 4 of J8

X3.Remove text in schematic for watchdog, put into design notes.
X4.change watchdog schematic picture.

X5.value display is broken on symbol for chip; need to fix.


X6.keep jp2 , Kill aux connector J1 and JP9; maybe kill JP 5,6,3

X7.RX and TX need to be switched for UART FTDI cable

X8. SDA/SCL pullups 4.7k, ESD protection, or such thing as an I2C driver chip.(protect from rest of circuit)

9.sheet 3, line needs 4V, but supply is only 3.3V
	1. V bus to different 3.3 powerbus
	2. or replace chip

10.radios schemic
	2 radios to add

11.
	** finish board this week ** 4 layer... needs more time.


**need value for pull up in 1
**pin for 2
**I think 6 is done
**Mile's says 7 is right
** need ESD
